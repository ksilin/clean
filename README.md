# Refactoring

applying the guidelines by Clean Code experts

 * Arrays.contains?

 * compare functionality to Calendar and Date

 * Boolean method isValidMonthCode is always inverted -> is only used to check if it is INvalid

 * how to unset the Alt+F7 (and perhaps several other kb shortcuts?).
 The settings->keyboard->application shortcuts only features a small selection
 Settings -> Settings Manager -> Settings Editor features the whole selection.
 A change at least is not reflected immediately -> restart and try again

* how to restrict history display of git to one branch only?
IntelliJ shows the revision where the file has been changed, not depending on the branch.
What I would like to see is the changes of a single branch (so the changes are attributed to the merge commits)

* git reset --hard does not remove untracked files. How to do them too?
* and while were at it - how to remove files with git rm and wildcards - **/date/WeekInMonth* didnt work
